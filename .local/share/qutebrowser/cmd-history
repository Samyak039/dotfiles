:open -t Consider the following statements about process state transitions for a system using preemptive scheduling. I. A running process can move to ready state. II. A ready process can move to running state. III. A blocked process can move to running state. IV. A blocked process can move to ready state.

:open -t Consider the following set of processes, assumed to have arrived at time 0. Consider the CPU scheduling algorithms Shortest Job First (SJF) and Round Robin (RR). For RR, assume that the processes are scheduled in the order P1, P2, P3, P4. If the time quantum for RR is 4 ms, then the absolute value of the difference between the average turnaround times (in ms) of SJF and RR (round off to 2 decimal places) is

:open -t Consider the set of processes with arrival time(in milliseconds), CPU burst time (in milliseconds), and priority(0 is the highest priority) shown below. None of the processes have I/O burst time.The average waiting time (in milliseconds) of all the processes using preemptive priority scheduling algorithm is ____.

:open -t In a computer system, memory-mapped access takes 100 nanoseconds when a page fault in the TLB. In case the page is not TLB, it takes 400 nanoseconds to access. As giving a hit ratio of 80%, the effective access time is
